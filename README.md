# CS 320 Software Testing and Automation Portfolio

This repository includes some of my best work from CS 320. It shows what I learned about software testing, automation, and how to make sure code works well and meets project requirements. 

From Project One, I uploaded the Contact Service files:
- Contact.java
- ContactService.java
- ContactTest.java
- ContactServiceTest.java

From Project Two, I added my written summary and reflection report.

These files show that I understand how to write unit tests in Java, how to check for errors in code, and how to meet software requirements by testing carefully.

## Reflection

**How can I make sure my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**  
I test my code using different inputs to make sure it works correctly. I use unit tests to catch problems early and to see if things break. I check for invalid data, like phone numbers that are too short or names that are too long, to help prevent bugs and make the program more secure.

**How do I understand user needs and include them in a program?**  
I follow the requirements in the project and think about what the user is trying to do. For example, if a phone number must be 10 digits, I write code to check that. I also test what happens when the wrong kind of data is used. That way, the program acts how the user expects.

**How do I design software?**  
I break the program into smaller parts that each do one thing. I use classes for things like contacts or tasks, and I create methods to add, update, or delete them. I also write tests for each part to make sure it works. Keeping my code organized helps me find mistakes faster and makes it easier to change things later.
